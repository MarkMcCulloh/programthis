Program This is a site designed for the everyday code junkie who's caught between great ideas. It is designed to feed off your boredom, and allow you to perfect your craft when you just can't think of something to program. Challenges range from easy to difficult, and will help you understand proper conduct and "almost-real-world" problem solving, while remaining pain-free and overall relaxing.
