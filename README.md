# Program This

This repository hosts all of my solutions to the challenges posted to [programthis](http://programthis.net). Be sure to check back often for updates.

## To add your own solutions

Sharing your solutions with the world is actually pretty easy, just follow these steps. Confused about some of them? Speak up, and contact me.

* Fork this repo
* Go into the folder of the challenge you have solved
* Place your code in the folder
* Rename your code as `username`.`extension` (if your username is JohnD and you wrote this in Python - `johnd.py`)
* Commit and push updates to your fork
* Submit a pull request with a title like `JohnD's solution to a-day-at-the-lanes`

And that's all! Be sure to include comments in your code including your contact info, the date, and anything else you'd like to add. If I *really* like it, you
might just get a little something.
